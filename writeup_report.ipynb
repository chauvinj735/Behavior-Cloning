    "The script model.py contains the code for training and saving the convolutional neural network. Note that this script imports a separate script, defineModel.py, to create the model. Note also that I save the model weights in model.h5, not the entire model. At one point I was running into problems with saving and loading the model, and decided to try saving just the weights. I used a separate script to hold the function the creates the model since this same function is needed by both model.py (for training the model) and drive.py (for reloading the model).

These three layers are followed by two additional convolutional layers (lines 30 and 32), both using a 3x3 kernel with 1x1 subsampling and valid padding. Both of these layers generate 64 features.

    "The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to start with a known architecture and make adjustments to it as necessary. I chose to start with the NVIDIA architecture discussed in the course materials since that architecture was used to solve a very similar problem, and since notes from Paul Heraty (a previous nano-degree student) indicated that it should work for this problem as well. In the end, I kept this architecture essentially as-is, adding only dropout layers to reduce over-fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that the training error was reduced steadily with each epoch but the validation error remained high. This was a clear indication of over-fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "To combat this over-fitting, I added dropout layers after the first three convolutional layers and all fully-connected layers (lines 22, 25, 28, 37, 39, 41, and 43 in defineModel.py). I also added a dropout layer (line 35) after the flattening layer (line 34) since this was recommended by one source from a Google search for good dropout strategies. After adding the dropout layers, both the training and the validation error were reduced with each epoch, although I did see some fluctuations in the validation error (i.e., reducing then rising slightly before reducing again) even with a relatively high dropout probability of 0.5. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are two variables for dropout probabilities in defineModel.py: convDropoutProb and fcnDropoutProb (lines 14 and 15). I initially tried using separate values for the convolutional layers and the fully-connected layers, but ultimately decided to assign both variables a value of 0.5 since this seemed to help mitigate over-fitting the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "After much trial and error in which I tried collecting new data, changing the model around, adding dropout layers, changing the dropout probability values, and adding in the left and right camera images along with their flipped versions, I finally settled on the architecture and primary dataset described above. I trained the model and used it to run the car in autonomous mode. The car drove very well in all but two places: the bridge and the turns with no lane markers. I then decided to keep this model as a baseline, collect more data focusing on these problem areas (see above discussion of secondary dataset), and then retrain just the fully-connected layers of my model with this new data. Thus, I added a transfer learning capability to model.py.\n",

Since the model was doing so well other than these limited problems, I decided to collect another full lap in both the clockwise and the counter-clockwise directions, and focused in particular on these problem areas by recording the car driving through them over and over again. For improved generalization, I also collected a lap around track two.
